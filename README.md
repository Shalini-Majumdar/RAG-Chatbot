# RAG Chatbot

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that combines semantic search with a local language model to provide fact-grounded answers from Wikipedia. Built using **LangChain**, **FAISS**, **Sentence Transformers**, and **Flan-T5**, and deployed via **Streamlit Cloud**.

## Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**  
  Combines dense vector retrieval (FAISS) with local generation (Flan-T5) for contextual answers.

- **LLM-powered Q&A**  
  Uses `google/flan-t5-base` or `flan-t5-large` for instruction-tuned text generation.

- **Wikipedia Knowledge Base**  
  Answers questions using chunks retrieved from the `wiki_snippets` dataset.

- **Streamlit UI**  
  Interactive, clean web interface for real-time question answering.

- **Hallucination Guard**  
  Returns a friendly fallback message if the system can't answer accurately.

## How It Works

1. **Chunk**: Wikipedia passages are split into ~500-character chunks with overlap.
2. **Embed**: Each chunk is converted to a dense vector using MiniLM.
3. **Index**: Vectors are stored and searched with FAISS.
4. **Retrieve**: Relevant chunks are retrieved based on your query.
5. **Generate**: Flan-T5 uses the chunks to generate a grounded answer.

## Example Questions to Try
- What is anarchism?
- What are the core principles of anarchism?
- What was Abraham Lincolnâ€™s policy on Native Americans?
- What are the natural wonders of Alabama?
- What is the origin of the name Alabama?

## Limitations
- Answers only questions based on the Wikipedia subset used (â‰ˆ500 chunks).
- Doesnâ€™t support live Wikipedia search or full internet queries.
- On Streamlit Cloud, initial load may be slow due to model download.
